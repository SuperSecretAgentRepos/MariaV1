						<h2 class="wht-text">"I decided to make a change for the better"</h2>
					</header>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p class="main-section-p">2 years ago I hit my heaviest weight, was diagnosed as "borderline diabetic". I was deep in depression and I was afraid for my and for my children's future. So I decided to make a change for the better. No matter how many diets, hours at the gym or weight loss pills I tried... I was not losing any weight and my health was not improving. 

						I had been following Maria on FB for a few years prior. One day I saw that she began to transform herself as well. I started to follow her more closely and saw her get thinner and thinner and more importantly.. Healthier. Mind, body and soul.</p>

						<p class="main-section-p">She has become my mentor.  She has been guiding me and helping me find different foods and exercises that would help me reach my goals. We both gradually ended up dropping animal products and eating clean. She is now a vegan and I am a vegetarian.</p>
						
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p class="main-section-p"> That has been one of the best decisions we have ever made. I could not have done this transition without my girl Maria. She has guided me into a better version of myself and has helped me come out of my shell and develop my skills as a teacher of love and spirituality.. Lol! </p>

						<p class="main-section-p">Here we are in the present day and stronger than ever. Most importantly my health is recovering at a rapid speed. I have so much energy now and I am excited for what the future holds. 


						I am extremely grateful for Maria's presence in my life. She is my soul sister and I will follow her where ever she goes. She is stuck with me for life!!! I trust her to see what I cannot see and to challenge my old version with the person I will be. Because she not only sees me.. But she sees the person I am becoming. She's got a gift and she is going places.. I love this girl...  My friend, my inspiration and my soul sister... I love u Maria... </p>
